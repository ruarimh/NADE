# Noise-Augmented Detectability Estimation (NADE)

Noise-Augmented Detectability Estimation (NADE) is a framework to estimate the impact of site-specific environmental noise on the acoustic detectability of different species.


This repository will contain the analysis code and example data associated with the manuscript:  

*Estimating how Site-Level Differences in Acoustic Environments Affect Species Detection by Machine Learning Models*

Preprint: [bioRxiv/Preprint link when available]

## ðŸš§ Status 
The code and a subset of the data used in the paper are **coming soon** (expected release: [September 2025]).  
For now, this repo serves as a placeholder to share with the preprint.
